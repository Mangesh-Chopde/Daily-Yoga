             <h3>Start your day with a glass of warm water with lemon</h3>
            <h7>Glass of Warm Water with Lemon:Starting it can help hydrate the body and provide a boost of vitamin C from the lemon. It's a refreshing and low-calorie way to kickstart your morning.</h7>

            <h7>Balanced Breakfast with Whole Grains, Fruits, and Protein:A balanced breakfast provides essential nutrients, energy, and helps maintain stable blood sugar levels throughout the morning. Whole grains offer fiber and sustained energy, fruits provide vitamins and minerals, and protein helps keep you full and satisfied.</h7>
           
            <h3>Include some healthy fats like avocado or nuts in your breakfast</h3>

        <h1>SUPTA BADDHA KONASAN</h1>
        <h3>The pose promotes circulation, enhances breathing, opens up the chest, releases the hips, strengthens and stretches the shoulders and centres and calms the mind. Based on what I have observed, practising Supta Baddha Konasana might provide not only physical benefits but also contribute to emotional well-being.</h3>
        <h2>precautions</h2>  <h3>In case of any type of injury in the knee - a tear of the ligament, worn down joints (where the lubrication between the joints has worn out), or rheumatoid arthritis, Baddha Konasana must be avoided. Also, students who have undergone knee, ankle, or hip surgery should avoid this pose.</h3>

        <h2>precautions</h2>  <h3>Anyone with an ankle, shoulder, hip, or knee joint injury must avoid practising the Balasana pose. Postnatal women who have had a caesarean section should refrain from placing additional pressure on their abdominal area.</h3>

        <h1>VIPARIT KARANI</h1>
      <h3> It alleviates stress, enhances self-healing, and aids in better circulation, making it beneficial for those with low blood pressure or veins related issues. This pose also eases tension in the lower back and hamstrings, reducing muscle cramps and headaches by improving blood flow and relaxing neck and back muscles</h3>
        <h2>precautions</h2>
      <h3>Since Viparita Karani Mudra works as a form of mild inversion, it should not be practiced during menstruation. People having serious neck and back pains or other problems should practice this asana in direct consultation with a professional yoga instructor.  Do not practice asana in case you suffer from severe eye problems such as glaucoma.
        In case you notice signs of tingling around your feet while performing this asana, make sure that you bend the knees and touch your soles so that you can bring the heels near the pelvis.</h3>
